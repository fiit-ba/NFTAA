# Technical documentation

This document serves as a guide for running our solution so that it can be conveniently launched and try or run our smart contract tests.

## Requirements
- NodeJS v19.7.0
- Node package manager 9.5.0
- Performant NPM 7.16.0
- Node Package Executor 9.5.0

## Hardhat
In folder nftaa_solidity, we will run command 'npm install' to install all requirements. After this, we can run 'npx hardhat test', which will execute our smart contract tests.

## Web app
To set up our web application, we must go to folder nftaa_dapp and run command 'pnpm install' to install all app requirements. After this, we can run 'pnpm dev -o', which will launch our web application on port 3000 and open it in a new web browser window.

# User guide

This chapter serves as a guide for anyone who would like to use our web application.

## Requirements

- Have our web NFTAA app running
- The browser used must have Metamask installed
- Metamask must have an active wallet

## Start
After we open our web application and click the Nftaa button in the top navigation menu, we see a screen like in figure 1. First, we need to connect our Metamask for interaction with the blockchain.

We have a button to connect via Metamask in the top right corner. After clicking, Metamask will display a popup asking permission to connect to your web application. Confirm the connection to grant access. Metamask may also prompt you to select the Ethereum network you want to connect to.
