# NFTAA Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a Hardhat use case for NFTAA. It comes with a sample contract which was extended, a test for the contracts, and a script that deploys contracts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
